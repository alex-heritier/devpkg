Comments: devpkg is a test program I'm writing to learn some C. The idea is from http://c.learncodethehardway.org/book/ex26.html.

ABOUT
From http://c.learncodethehardway.org/book/ex26.html, "Devpkg is a simple C program that installs other software [...] it just grabs code from the internet (or local files) and does the usual ./configure ; make ; make install every programmer does."

TODO:
- download source from URL
- run ./configure, make, make install on the source
